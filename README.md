**Simply Colorful** is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme for desktop created by [LorenzoPegorari](https://github.com/LorenzoPegorari).

This theme was created for the following reasons:
1. to make the most prominent parts of the notes pop out more, making *skimming* faster
2. to quickly distinguish every portion of the notes (different headings, internal links, external links, etc.)
3. to give the user a visually pleasing note-taking experience by making a strong use of the chosen personalized *accent color*

# Disclaimer
This theme is provided as is, and is designed for my personal use of Obsidian on Windows 10 and Windows 11. As such, it is not thoroughly tested across all operating systems and use cases.

This theme modifies some parts of the obsidian interface, so it may break with future updates. It may also be incompatible with other bits of custom CSS snippets you have.
