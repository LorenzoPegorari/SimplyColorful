# Disclaimer
This theme is provided as is, and is designed for my personal use of Obsidian on Windows 10 and Windows 11. As such, it is not thoroughly tested across all operating systems and use cases.

This theme modifies significant parts of the obsidian interface, so it may break with future updates. It may also incompatible with other bits of custom CSS snippets you have.
